<h1>CoinWorks Library</h1>

A Java/Scala library for Bitcoin. The software was used for the following projects:



  
  <h3>3. [Under submission] ChainNet: Learning on Blockchain Graphs with Topological Features</h3>
  <p>Using persistent homology based ideas, we offer an elegant, easily extendable and computationally light approach for graph representation learning on Blockchain networks to predict cryptocurrency prices.</p>
  
 <h3>2. <a href = "http://cakcora.github.io/blockchain/576.pdf">Forecasting Bitcoin Price with Graph Chainlets </a> (PAKDD 2018) </h3>
  <p>We introduce a novel concept of chainlets, or Bitcoin subgraphs, which allows us to evaluate the local topological structure of the Bitcoin graph over time.</p>
  
  <h3>1. <a href = "http://cakcora.github.io/blockchain/blockchainsurvey1_1.pdf">Blockchain: A Graph Primer</a></h3>
  <p>Aug 2017 Version 1.1</p>
  <p>We offer a holistic view on Blockchain. Starting with a brief history, we give the building blocks of Blockchain,
and explain their interactions. As graph mining has become a major part its analysis, we elaborate on graph theoretical
aspects of the Blockchain technology.</p>



<h2>Data Files</h2>
Our data spans from 2009 to 2018 in each file:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="/data/dailyOccmatrices2009-2018.rar">Chainlet occurrence matrices</a>: Each data file contains the matrix of the day. The file occ2009003.csv gives a 20x20 matrix of chainlet occcurences for year 2009 and day 003.</li>
  <li> Chainlet amount matrices:</li>
  <li> Graeve's feature values:</li>
  <li> Betti numbers 0 and 1:</li>
  <li> Filtered matrices</li>
  <li> Bitcoin prices</li>
  
</ul>
